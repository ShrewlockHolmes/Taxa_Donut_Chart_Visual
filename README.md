# Taxa_Donut_Chart_Visual
This is an R script that can create a circular plot that shows the diversity of taxa within a dataset at different levels

It includes the R script, required libraries and example dataset to run example (see image below)

There is still a requirement to alter the angle of 2-3 labels in a free illustrator editor such as inkscape. See profile image for example of final image
